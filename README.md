Server side of a LegalTech web app that was developped in partnership with a European law firm in 2019. The goal of the app is to streamline and automatize the creation of legal documents that are usually time-consuming, error prone and low-value added for the firm.

Custom in-house algorithm was built to handle all calculations for the documents. Output is a clean word format (docx) document that can be easily reviewed and printed by a member of the firm.

Back end developped with NodeJS / Sequelize.
